Thi sis the easiest way to use a libraty, just a script link  on the html file.
Alternatevely we download the file and add it to the webpase folder and add reference to html.

JQuery

$ is the operator used to select elements, equivalent to querySelectorAll
$ is a shothand for jQuery() method

After selecting it gives back a JQuery object. All methods only works on this type of object.
QuerySelecotrAll returns a nodelist.

WE can use method get() to select which element form the returned array (get(0) or get(1))


Bootstrap

Library to help design interface grip on multiple screen size.

We need to add the CDN references on the html file. Instructions are on bootstrap main page.

Bootstrap is all based on assigning classes to the elements

Emmett in vs code => button.bt.bnt-lg => <button class="btn btn-lg"></button>

For screen readers we can use role=alert to indincate that so,ething is important and need to be focused
Aria-label="" to define a explanation to something, a name to an idon or drawing
aria-hidden="true" so screen readers ignore it
