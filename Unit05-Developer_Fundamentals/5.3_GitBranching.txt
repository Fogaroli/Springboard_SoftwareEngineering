Part I:

- What ***git*** command creates a branch?
    To create a branch use "git branch <name of the branch>" or "git checkout -b <name of the branch."

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
    Fast forward is a simple merging algorithm where the commits goes on top of each other.
    Recursive merge algorithm is a process that uses inputs from different branches in order to combine the changes and then add a commit with changes comming from both soruces.

- What ***git*** command changes to another branch?
    "git checkout <branch name>" changes the working are to a different branch

- What ***git*** command deletes a branch?
    To delete a branch we can use "git branch -d <name of the branch>" if the branch was already merged, or use -D instead of -d to delete the branch and all changes made with it.

- How do merge conflicts happen?
    When changes are made on the same file, or same area of the code on both branches that are being merged, git does not know which one to use.


    Part II:

    Git recursive added a commit on top of the others
    Git conflict also have one extr acommit whicis the fix for the conflicts on teh files found.
